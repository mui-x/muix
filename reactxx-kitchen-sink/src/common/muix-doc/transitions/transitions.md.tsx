# Transitions

### Transition helps make a UI expressive and easy to use.

Material-UI provides a number of transitions that can be used to introduce some basic
[motion](https://material.io/design/motion/)
to your applications components.

To better support server rendering Material-UI provides a \`style\` property
to the children of some transition components (Fade, Grow, Zoom, Slide).
The \`style\` property must be applied to the DOM for the animation to work as expected.

\`\`\`jsx
// The \`props\` object contains a \`style\` property.
// You need to provide it to the \`div\` element as shown here.
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div {...props}>
      Fade
    </div>
  );
}

export default Main() {
  return (
    <Fade>
      <MyComponent />
    </Fade>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Collapse

Expand vertically from the top of the child element.
The \`collapsedHeight\` property can be used to set the minimum height when not expanded.

## Fade

Fade in from transparent to opaque.

## Grow

Expand outwards from the center of the child element, while also fading in
from transparent to opaque.

The second example demonstrates how to change the \`transform-origin\`, and conditionally applies
the \`timeout\` property to change the entry speed.

## Slide

Slide in from the edge of the screen.
The \`direction\` property controls which edge of the screen the transition starts from.

The Transition component's  \`mountOnEnter\` property prevents the child component from being mounted
until \`in\` is \`true\`. This prevents the relatively positioned component from scrolling into view
from it's off-screen position. Similarly the \`unmountOnExit\` property removes the component
from the DOM after it has been transition off screen.

## Zoom

Expand outwards from the center of the child element.

This example also demonstrates how to delay the enter transition.
