# Chips

### Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.

[Chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html) allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

While included here as a standalone component, the most common use will
be in some form of input, so some of the behaviour demonstrated here is
not shown in context.

## Chip

Examples of Chips, using an image Avatar, SVG Icon Avatar, "Letter"
and (string) Avatar.

- Chips with the \`onClick\` property defined change appearance on focus,
  hover, and click.
- Chips with the \`onDelete\` property defined will display a delete
  icon which changes appearance on hover.

## Chip array

An example of rendering multiple Chips from an array of values.
Deleting a chip removes it from the array. Note that since no
\`onClick\` property is defined, the Chip can be focused, but does not
gain depth while clicked or touched.
