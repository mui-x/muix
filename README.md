# ReactXX

Framework which enables creation of visual components for both **react** and **react-native**

*Notice: the whole project is in **proof of concept** stage*

## Helper packages

- [reactxx-mdi](https://github.com/reactxx/reactxx/tree/master/build-icons) - Material Design Icons essentials for both react and react-native
- [reactxx-stateman](https://github.com/reactxx/reactxx/tree/master/muix/src/stateman) - state manager inspired by react 16.3 context api
- [reactxx-mui](https://github.com/reactxx/reactxx/tree/master/muix/src/mui) - bridge to material-ui and material-ui compatible native components

## Examples

- [Responsible drawer](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/reactxx/reactxx/tree/master/reactxx-kitchen-sink?autoresize=1&codemirror=1&fontsize=12&module=%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fresponsible-drawer%2Fresponsible-drawer.tsx&view=preview) - Code for both Drawer component and example application are 100% cross platform (React Native EXPO app comming soon...)

## TODO

- [ ] KitchenSink for web and native
- [ ] move CSS in JS animation extension to helper package
- [ ] move CSS in JS media query extension to helper package
- [x] simple primitives (Text, View, Icon, ScrollView, AnimatedText, AnimatedView, AnimatedIcon, AnimatedScrollView)
