# TODO

- codeClasses is map of Ruleset array
- merging to flat ruleset performs in mergeRulesets 
- ruleset patches modifies codeClasses arrays

- $when
root: {
  $when: {
    disabled: {
    }
  }
}

if any $when exists => codeClasses is converted to { root: { $whenName:'root', value: {..ruleset} }} 
mergeRulesets: 
- has codeClasses as first argument
- $whenName evidence, ev. uses codeClasses[$whenName]
